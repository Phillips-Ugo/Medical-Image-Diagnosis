# 🧠 AI-Powered Skin Disease Diagnosis with GAN-Based Dark Skin Image Augmentation

This project is an AI-driven healthcare app focused on improving early detection of skin diseases, especially across diverse skin tones. It utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (EfficientNet) alongside Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate synthetic dark skin images, addressing the underrepresentation of darker skin types in medical datasets. Additionally, resampling techniques are applied to handle overall class imbalance, enhancing model robustness and fairness. The app features a Streamlit interface for image upload, diagnosis prediction, and a medical chatbot for condition insights and treatment guidance.

## 🚀 How It Works

### 1. Dataset Preprocessing

* Based on HAM10000 and additional skin lesion datasets.
* Images resized, normalized, and split into train/validation sets.

### 2. Handling Class Imbalance & Skin Tone Representation

* Trained **GANs to generate synthetic images representing dark skin tones**, enriching underrepresented demographic data.
* Applied **resampling techniques** (oversampling minority classes, undersampling major classes) to balance dataset distribution.
* Combined these strategies led to improved model generalization, especially for skin disease detection in darker skin.

### 3. Model Architecture

* Fine-tuned `EfficientNetB0` on the augmented, balanced dataset.
* Implemented with TensorFlow/Keras, including callbacks for early stopping and model checkpointing.

### 4. Streamlit Web App

* Upload skin lesion images → model predicts disease class → displays prediction with confidence scores.
* Medical chatbot for user queries on symptoms, causes, and treatments.
* Optionally find nearby clinics/hospitals based on user location.
